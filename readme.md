# Emotiv EDF Fixer

The Emotiv TestBench Software can record EEG data from Emotiv headsets, but the .edf files generated have errors that make them unreadable for most of the .edf readers (At least in the version 3.1.21). EmotivEDFFixer is a simple utility that creates new files from the ones generated by Emotiv TestBench that are fixed and can be readable.
